# Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

# Input Format

# First line contains the value of size of your array
# Line consists of 'n' space seperated integers representing the values present in the Array
# Third line having the K value, how much you want to rotate
# Constraints

# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
# 0 <= k <= 10^5
# Output Format

# Rotated Array
# Sample Input 0

# 7
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
# 3
# Sample Output 0

# 5 6 7 1 2 3 4
# Explanation 0

# rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
# rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
